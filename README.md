 ## Deprecated
This repository contains previous work for local speech-to-text -> LLM -> text-to-speech workflow to support twilio phone calls, using ollama tinyllm model & kyurai stt & tts models. It is deprecated due to opting for openai realtime API to prevent latency & conversation security issues.
However, we will revisit when we are willing to dedicate time to reduce latency & provide more customizations to our voice agent.
